# Mythographer README

Creative design and generation of myths.

This app will allow anyone to create unique stories and "worlds" based on elements from existing mythologies.
After selecting the desired elements (like gods, heroes, cultures, geography) a story will be created using artificial intellegence.  Additional features could include generation of images, memes, or items of "lore."
